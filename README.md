An open movie recommendation API that has been built using Google Colab and deployed on Streamlit localtunnel.



It implements the following features:

* Just enter one movie name then it will recommend 5 movies at the same time.

## Platform Used

* Google Cloud - This whole app is based on Google Cloud reason being that I wanted to build an app  that is easy to test and deploy as well as function that does not require many
